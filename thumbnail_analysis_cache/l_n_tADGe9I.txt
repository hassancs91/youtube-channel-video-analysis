The thumbnail is effective due to several key elements:

1. **Bold Text and Numbers**: The use of large, bold text displaying "$114,350 IN 90 DAYS" immediately captures attention. The contrast between the yellow and white text highlights the significant earning, creating a sense of curiosity and urgency.

2. **Color Contrast**: The combination of bright colors with a greenish-blue background makes the text and graphics pop, ensuring that the important information is easily readable.

3. **Emotional Expression**: The surprised expression of the person in the thumbnail triggers curiosity. It suggests an unexpected or impressive result, making viewers want to know more about how it was achieved.

4. **Use of Symbols**: The arrow pointing to the "AI" symbol suggests a causal relationship, hinting that artificial intelligence played a role in achieving the financial figure, which can intrigue viewers interested in AI.

5. **Simplicity and Focus**: The thumbnail is not cluttered, focusing on key elements (amount, time frame, AI icon, and facial expression), which clearly conveys the video's main idea at a glance.

Overall, these elements work together to create an appealing and clickable thumbnail that promises valuable content.
