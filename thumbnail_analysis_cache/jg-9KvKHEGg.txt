The YouTube thumbnail you provided is effective due to several key elements:

1. **Bold Text**: The use of words like "Free Tool" and "FAST" in large, bold lettering immediately grabs attention. The contrast with the background ensures the text is easily readable.

2. **Clear Message**: The text conveys a strong, enticing message indicating the content will be about increasing users quickly and for free, which is appealing to viewers looking to grow their audience or business.

3. **Color Contrast**: The thumbnail uses vibrant colors with strong contrasts (yellow, black, red, blue, green) to stand out. The yellow and black combination is particularly striking.

4. **Visual Elements**: The use of a friendly, smiling face adds a personal touch, making it more relatable and inviting. It can also build a connection with viewers who may recognize the person.

5. **Statistics Display**: Including a specific figure (660K new users with a 354.7% increase) adds credibility and piques curiosity about how such growth was achieved.

6. **Emotional Triggers**: The positive expressions and upward graph markers suggest success and growth, triggering curiosity and excitement.

7. **Directional Cue**: The red arrow directs attention to the 660K statistic, emphasizing its importance and prompting the viewer to read it.

Overall, this combination of elements effectively draws in viewers by promising valuable information in an engaging, visually appealing manner.
