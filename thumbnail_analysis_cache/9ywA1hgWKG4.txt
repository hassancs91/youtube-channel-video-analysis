The thumbnail is effective for several reasons:

1. **Clear Messaging**: The text "Build & Sell APIs" and "FULL GUIDE" is straightforward and tells viewers exactly what to expect from the video. The use of large, bold text ensures readability, even on smaller screens.

2. **Engaging Imagery**: The smiling person adds a personal touch and can create a connection with the audience. The icons depicting "API" and money visually represent the video's topic, making it easy to understand at a glance.

3. **Contrasting Colors**: The background is dark, which contrasts well with the lighter text and icons, making them stand out. Bright colors on the monetary symbols draw attention and highlight the financial aspect.

4. **Emotion**: The individual’s smile generates a positive emotional response, likely increasing viewer interest.

5. **Composition**: The balanced layout with the person's image on one side and the graphics on the other keeps the thumbnail organized and visually appealing.

Overall, these elements combine to create a thumbnail that is informative, visually attractive, and likely to entice clicks.
