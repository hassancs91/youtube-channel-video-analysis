The YouTube thumbnail is effective due to several key elements:

1. **Clear Text**: The phrase "Copy This System" is bold, simple, and placed against a bright yellow background, making it easy to read and attention-grabbing.

2. **Engaging Visuals**: The image of a smiling man pointing towards the diagram creates a sense of enthusiasm and directs the viewer's focus to the central content. His expression adds a human element that can engage viewers emotionally.

3. **Visual Hierarchy**: The layout uses a clear hierarchy, with the text at the top immediately conveying the video's theme, followed by the visual representation of the system being discussed.

4. **Color Contrast**: The use of contrasting colors (yellow text box, blue background) helps key elements stand out, making the thumbnail more noticeable.

5. **Diagram**: Including a workflow or system diagram hints at the content's instructional and informative nature, appealing to viewers interested in learning a new method or strategy.

6. **Mystery and Intrigue**: The thumbnail invites curiosity by not showing all details of the "system," encouraging viewers to click to learn more about what this system entails.

By combining these elements, the thumbnail effectively captures attention and encourages potential viewers to click on the video to learn more about the system being promoted.
